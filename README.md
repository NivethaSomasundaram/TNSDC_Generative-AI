MODELLING
Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources such as loan applications, borrower information, credit history, financial statements, and historical default records. Ensure the data is clean, complete, and representative of the target population.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and performing any necessary transformations such as feature engineering or dimensionality reduction.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the random forest model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
Model Training: Train a random forest classifier using the training data. Random forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Tune hyperparameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples per leaf to optimize the model's performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing data. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess the model's ability to predict loan defaulters accurately.
Feature Importance: Analyze the feature importance scores generated by the random forest model to understand which variables have the most significant impact on predicting loan defaulters. This information can help identify key risk factors and guide decision-making.
7.Model Interpretation: Interpret the random forest model to explain how it makes predictions and identify patterns or insights relevant to loan default prediction. Use techniques such as partial dependence plots, SHAP values, or feature importance plots for model interpretability.
8.Model Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance and interpretability, deploy it in a production environment where it can be used to predict loan defaulters for new loan applications in real-time.
RESULTS
Accuracy: Random forest models typically achieve high accuracy rates in predicting loan defaulters, often ranging from 80% to 95% or higher depending on the dataset and model complexity.
Precision and Recall: Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted defaulters among all predicted defaulters, while recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted defaulters among all actual defaulters. A balanced model would have high precision and recall values, indicating both low false positives and false negatives.
F1-Score: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced measure of a model's performance, especially when dealing with imbalanced classes (e.g., fewer defaulters compared to non-defaulters).
ROC-AUC: The Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) metric evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between defaulters and non-defaulters across different thresholds. A higher ROC-AUC value (closer to 1) indicates better discrimination power of the model.
Feature Importance: Random forest models provide feature importance scores, which can help identify the most significant variables contributing to loan default prediction. This information can be valuable for risk assessment and decision-making.
6.Model Interpretability: Random forest models can offer insights into how they make predictions, such as which features are most influential and how they interact. This interpretability is crucial for stakeholders to understand and trust the model's decisions.
7.Business Impact: Ultimately, the success of a random forest model for predicting loan defaulters is measured by its business impact, such as reduced credit risk, lower default rates, improved loan portfolio performance, and enhanced decision-making efficiency.
